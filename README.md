# HTML-Php
During my module 'Web Applications Technologies' we constructed a portfolio that awarded me a first grade (80%). This portfolio is how we learnt HTML and php languages and put them into practise.
This includes:
  - SQL
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Php
  - Forms (eCommerce)
  - Sessions

I used PhpMyAdmin to query databases using SQL. Throughout the portfolio I will be making references/querys to tables in my PhpMyAdmin account.
