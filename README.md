# HTML-Php
During my module 'Web Applications Technologies' we constructed a portfolio that awarded me a first grade. This portfolio is how we learnt HTML and php languages and put them into practise.

We used PhpMyAdmin to query databases using SQL. Throughout the portfolio I will be making references/querys to tables in my PhpMyAdmin account.
