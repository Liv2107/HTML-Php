        <h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
        <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
        <p>A paragraph with <i>some words that are emphasized</i> and <b>some important words.</b>
        Followed by some <span class="highWord">hightlighted words.</span> Feel free to add any other text formatting.</p>

        <pre>This is some text 
that is laid out exactly
Laid out at code level without any additional 
markup</pre>

        <h3><b>Special Characters</b></h3>
        <p>The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also &gt;. 
            The browser also ignores any line breaks &nbsp;<br />in your code and any white space.

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. 
            You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk">Leeds Beckett</a>. 
            Links to other pages of the <a href="www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk">same site</a>. 
            Links to another point in the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/courses/computer-science-bsc/">same page</a>.

        <h4>Images</h4>

        <img src="box.jpg" alt="box">

        <p>This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder. I hope you added an alt 
            attribute to support screen readers. Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using W3C Markup Validation
Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on the page and choose inspect or view source you can check your code and
see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag.     </p>
